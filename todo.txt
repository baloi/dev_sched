* test group/add_resident/:id with the form contents
  1 through post 'add_resident', :id => id, :resident => resident_id
  2 test that view contains :resident and :id (restclient.get 'group/add_resident')
  3 check if resident is really added to DB 
D test group/add_resident/:id


* fix group_controller_test, group_controller, app/views/group/show.rthml
  - it should be show/:id or show?id=:id
* groups pages: 
  - create, edit and delete as well as add residents...
* work on calculating groups (by day depending on insurance)
  - should be able to base decisions on MDS


* tools to use...
  - Jamis Buck of Rails Core Team, sqlite driver for ruby creator, Capistrano library for deploying ruby
    uses vim, testunit vs rspec.
  - vim just rocks for editing text. I don't picture myself programming with relaxed fingers using emacs
    (I think they are right that you have to be a spider to use emacs)
    vim is just plain old simple nirvana!
  
* figure out the algo for groups lookback period... 
* group creation...
* an easier way to edit sessions
* make caseload savable in db..
* study macruby with cocoa

* copy a rehab day to the next or from another rehab day


coding:
D show_by_therapist should only show active
D update residents, set inactive to active-false

---- later ----
* spreadsheet scheduling via cocoa
* transfer all 'views/session/new.rhtml' form elements to views/session/_form.rhtml
  . check via new and 'edit' actions
* make a spreadsheet gui for entering and editing sessions for each therapist
  (like PT schedule excel)

D check if all in groups are in 15 minutes

D Remember: work on dev_barn, deployed is ~/barn (dev_barn at home and barn for work and data)
D change implementation from ~/dev_barn and change data from ~/barn
D decide on fossil or git, how about pomodoro?
D make dev_barn a fossil copy 

D make fossil repo/dir for project for purposes of easy reversions

D How do we destroy a therapist from Resident.therapists??
  D 1. copy therapist_id from TherapistResidents to Resident.pt
     - loop through therapist_residents
       resident = Resident.find(therapist_resident.resident_id)
       resident.pt = therapist_resident.therapist_id
  D 2. check data all residents to pt(id) to therapist_resident.therapist_id
  3. delete therapist_residents table
  4. set associations: 
     Resident WILL NOT have therapists... (only pt or ot)
     Resident belongs to physical_therapist
